# SQL-SmashData
An implementation of basic and good uses of SQL(MS) for YHack 2017

I started learning SQL at YHack 2017 to learn more about query languages. Here, I 
created a Database used from SmashBoard's https://smashboards.com/rankings/melee/league,
along with some insight I knew about the players themselves. I applied my newfound
knowledge of SQL with data I was interested in myself.
